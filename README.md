Portfolio Projects:
This portfolio showcases various projects I have worked on, demonstrating a range of skills in web and app development, AI, robotics, and game design.

CoffeeMachineApp:
A simple application that simulates the operations of a coffee machine, handling user input to make different coffee selections, while tracking resources and simulating real-time processes.

Iris Flower Classification:
A machine learning project that classifies iris flower species based on petal and sepal characteristics. It uses popular classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy.

Jumping Stick:
A 2D arcade-style game where the player jump between cylinders to score points. The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses.

Physics at College:
An educational project offering a series of interactive physics courses. These courses cover topics with a focus on practical applications. 

Pong AI Challenge:
A Pong game where the player competes against an AI opponent. The AI adapts its strategy as the game progresses, offering a challenging experience.

Racing Game:
A 2D racing game where the player controls a car on a randomly generated road. The goal is to stay on the road as long as possible while managing speed and avoiding obstacles.

SecureText AES:
A security-focused app that uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to encrypt and decrypt text messages. The app ensures data privacy by allowing secure communication.

TechNav:
An industrial robot control and monitoring system. TechNav allows real-time tracking and control of robotic movements, optimizing workflow and ensuring precision in industrial tasks.

Solar System Explorer:
Solar System Explorer allows users to explore the planets and other celestial bodies within our solar system. Through an intuitive interface and interactive features, users can view detailed information, compare planetary characteristics, and discover important historical and scientific data about each planet and associated space missions.

This portfolio highlights my ability to work across a wide range of fields, from game development to robotics and AI-driven applications.
