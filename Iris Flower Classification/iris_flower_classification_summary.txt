# Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning in Python

## 1. Setup the Environment
This project uses the PyCharm Community Edition IDE and the Iris dataset in CSV format downloaded from OpenCourseWare at MIT. The following packages are required:
- **NumPy**: For computational operations with arrays, matrices, and linear algebra.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn**: For creating statistical data visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating statistical plots.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

### Import Libraries and Load the Dataset
Libraries are imported, and the Iris dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame named `df`.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to analyze the dataset, summarizing its main characteristics.

### Summarize the Dataset
- **Shape**: The dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns.
- **Head**: Displays the first 5 rows of the data.
- **Info**: Provides a summary of the DataFrame including index dtype and columns.
- **Describe**: Generates a statistical description of the data.
- **Value Counts**: Shows the frequency of unique classes in the dataset.

### Create Visualizations
- **Violin Plots**: Compare the distribution of variables across different Iris species.
- **Pairs Plot**: Helps understand pairwise relationships between different variables.
- **Heatmap**: Visualizes pairwise correlation between numerical features.

## 3. Build and Train the Model
Six different machine learning algorithms are tested:
1. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Decision Tree (DT)**
4. **Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (NB)**
5. **Support Vector Machine (SVC)**
6. **Random Forest (RF)**

The dataset is split into training (80%) and test (20%) datasets. Stratified K-fold Cross Validation is used to estimate model accuracy, with SVC yielding the highest accuracy at approximately 98%.

## 4. Evaluate Predictions
The SVC model is used for predictions on the test dataset. The accuracy score is approximately 97%. A confusion matrix and classification report are generated to evaluate the model's performance, showing excellent results in precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusion
The SVC model performed exceptionally well in classifying Iris flower species based on their features, showcasing the effectiveness of machine learning in pattern recognition and classification tasks.
